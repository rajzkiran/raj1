            Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a
            Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical
            spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to
            those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.

            FAVOURITE FOOD : CHICKEN

        <p>
            The chicken is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have
            also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male
            birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
